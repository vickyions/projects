        Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 - 23 March 1931) was an Indain
        revolutionary freedom fighter who was hanged to death by British
        colonisers at the age of 23 years. Fondly known as 'Shaheed (martyr)
        Bhagat Singh', he is considered a national hero of India's freedom
        struggle against colonial rule. As a teenager, Bhagat Singh popularised
        the slogan of Inquilab Zindabad (Eng: "Long live the revolution";
        Urdu:<i> اِنقلاب زِنده باد</i>; Hindi:<i> इंक़लाब ज़िन्दाबाद)</i> which
        eventually became the catchphrase of the Indian independence movement.

            Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and
            arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in
            a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was
            released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest.i

            Killing of <i>John Saunders</i>: Revenge for the death of
            <i>Lala Lajpat Rai</i> due to a lathi charge ordered by the
            superintendent of police <i>James A. Scott</i> on protesters
            protesting against the <i>Simon Commission</i>, in which Rai was
            personally assualted and died of heart attack on 17 Nov 1928. Singh
            conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev
            Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott. However, in a case of
            mistaken identity, the plotters shot <i>John P. Saunders</i>, an
            Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District
            Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928.

            Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism
            but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of
            Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol,
            the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months
            each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the
            rest of northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs
            grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved was
            something amazing.
