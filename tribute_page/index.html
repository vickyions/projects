          Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 - 23 March 1931) was an Indain
          revolutionary freedom fighter who was hanged to death by British
          colonisers at the age of 23 years. Fondly known as 'Shaheed (martyr)
          Bhagat Singh', he is considered a national hero of India's freedom
          struggle against colonial rule. As a teenager, Bhagat Singh
          popularised the slogan of Inquilab Zindabad (Eng: "Long live the
          revolution"; Urdu:<i> اِنقلاب زِنده باد</i>; Hindi:<i>
            इंक़लाब ज़िन्दाबाद)</i
          >
          which eventually became the catchphrase of the Indian independence
          movement.

              Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and
              arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved
              in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He
              was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his
              arrest.i

              <strong>Killing of <i>John Saunders</i>:</strong> Revenge for the
              death of <i>Lala Lajpat Rai</i> due to a lathi charge ordered by
              the superintendent of police <i>James A. Scott</i> on protesters
              protesting against the <i>Simon Commission</i>, in which Rai was
              personally assualted and died of heart attack on 17 Nov 1928.
              Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru,
              Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott. However, in
              a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot
              <i>John P. Saunders</i>, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as
              he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17
              December 1928.

              Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of
              terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the
              honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He
              became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and
              within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a
              lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his
              name. Innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the
              man achieved was something amazing.

              <strong>Killing <i>Channan Singh</i>:</strong> After killing
              Saunders, the group escaped through the D.A.V. College entrance,
              across the road from the District Police Headquarters. Chanan
              Singh, a Head Constable who was chasing them, was shot dead by
              Chandrashekhar Azad. They then fled on bicycles to pre-arranged
              safe houses.

              <strong>Escape from Lahore:</strong> Bhagat Singh and Rajguru,
              both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the next day.
              Dressed in western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his
              beard and wore a hat over cropped hair), and carrying Devi's
              sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young couple, while
              Rajguru carried their luggage as their servant. At the station,
              Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets, and
              the three boarded the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur).
              There they boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah
              railway station usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train
              from Lahore. At Lucknow, Rajguru left separately for Benares while
              Singh, Devi and the infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh
              returning to Lahore a few days later.

              <strong>Delhi Assembly bombing and arrest:</strong> In 1929, he
              proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive
              publicity for their aims. Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French
              anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, Singh's
              plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative
              Assembly. The nominal intention was to protest against the Public
              Safety Bill, and the Trade Dispute Act, which had been rejected by
              the Assembly but were being enacted by the Viceroy using his
              special powers; the actual intention was for the perpetrators to
              allow themselves to be arrested so that they could use court
              appearances as a stage to publicise their cause.
            </p>

            <p>
              The HSRA leadership was initially opposed to Bhagat's
              participation in the bombing because they were certain that his
              prior involvement in the Saunders shooting meant that his arrest
              would ultimately result in his execution. However, they eventually
              decided that he was their most suitable candidate. On 8 April
              1929, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into
              the Assembly chamber from its public gallery while it was in
              session. The bombs had been designed not to kill,[30] but some
              members, including George Ernest Schuster, the finance member of
              the Viceroy's Executive Council, were injured. The smoke from the
              bombs filled the Assembly so that Singh and Dutt could probably
              have escaped in the confusion had they wished. Instead, they
              stayed shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long Live the
              Revolution") and threw leaflets. The two men were arrested and
              subsequently moved through a series of jails in Delhi.

              <strong>Execution:</strong> Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were
              sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be
              hanged on 24 March 1931. The schedule was moved forward by 11
              hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm in the
              Lahore jail. It is reported that no magistrate at the time was
              willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was required by law. The
              execution was supervised instead by an honorary judge, who also
              signed the three death warrants, as their original warrants had
              expired. The jail authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall
              of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the three
              men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village, and
              then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about 10 kilometres
              (6.2 mi) from Ferozepore.
